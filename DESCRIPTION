Description: Launches BLAST+ searches across multiple query files and subject
    databases using parallel processing. Designed for workflows
    that need to crunch through tons of comparisons, SnailBLAST handles job
    orchestration, result merging, and error handling. Faster than a speeding
    snail, but just as reliable.
